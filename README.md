A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I have gained experience in communication and content management while working in digital start-ups in non-tech positions. I have Life Sciences background from King's College London, have represented my course and ran events for one of the most prominent students theatre society - King's Players.

However, I have always been interested in IT, that is why I have transformed my career to become a web developer.  Most recently I enrolled on the Software Development course in Makers Academy and looking for junior full-stack engineer position.
