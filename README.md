A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I am a coding bootcamp graduate with a background in Life Sciences. I worked in tech environments in non-tech position as a research and communication coordinator, managed traffic and social media. I have completed the Software Development course at Makers Academy and looking for a position of the software developer.
