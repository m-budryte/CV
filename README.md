A Full-Stack Software Developer with a previous background in Life Sciences. I have recently changed careers and completed coding bootcamp at the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have made this decision after gaining experience in tech companies, working on manual Quality Assurance testing, localisation and content management. I am currently looking for a junior developer role in a company, that values extreme programming values, Agile development process and will support my career progression.

## Projects

Projects|Description|Tech Stack
---|---|---
[**Neto**, Makers](https://github.com/mattTea/magnetism ) | Final Project at the Makers Academy. We have created an app for self-learning using two new languages within two weeks. Users are able to choose topics, subtopics, access resources and assess their understanding by rating each resource. I coordinated the front-end development process, making sure that every team member understood the code and made decisions on styling. I also made sure that front-end contents tested. | Python, Flask, React
[**Open Food Network UK Dev Hack**](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork)| The first hackathon I’ve attended and the first opportunity for me to work with a real codebase.  I was able to put the knowledge I had received in the coding bootcamp, such as agile practices, pair programming and debugging. The OFN gave me an opportunity to work with new technologies, as they were using AngularJS in the front-end as well as solidify my knowledge in Rails. In particular, I have made edits allowing missing translations to show up, updated website information and changed CSS styling. |Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, Coffeescript, HTML/CSS
[**Acebook**, Makers](https://github.com/m-budryte/acebook-zuckerbros), |This was my first Rails project and the second group challenge I did at the Makers coding bootcamp. Throughout this two-week project out team used Agile practices (e.g. daily stand-ups and retros, use of story points, sprints etc). We also had a chance to learn new frameworks, such as Rails and Coffeescript. In addition to the main task we were challenged to implement a chat room, using Action Cable functionality. Currently, users can log in, post into the feed and join the chat room. I was nominated as a Scrum master for two of the sprints and made sure the team had met the goals. Working in a pair with another team member I have built and styled chat room. | Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Coffeescript, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap.

## Skills

#### Fast and independent learning

I have always been very inquisitive and before joining coding bootcamp, I have taken coding courses, available on the codecademy, SoloLearn, freeCodeCamp and others.
During my time at [Makers Academy](makers.tech) I’ve improved my self-learning skills, recognised the importance of self-assessment and time-boxing.
While working at [myrecovery](https://www.myrecovery.ai/) I have been given a task to research video editing and then explain the best practices to the rest of the team.
I also continue my learning in the field of Nutrition while writing articles for  [Wonderzine](https://www.wonderzine.com/), which requires extensive research and reading scientific articles to challenge common misconceptions around food and its effects on health.

#### Communication
Before becoming a developer, I was heavily involved in the communication. For example, when I worked for [TheQuestion](https://thequestion.com/), I contacted prominent academics and other experts. I also worked on the growing the community and maintaining social media.
I believe that communication is the key in the effective web development and while being at Makers I improved this skill, particularly learned to give and receive constructive feedback, as well as be able to express my ideas to the team project.
Additionally, I worked in customer service and hospitality which further helped me to improve my communication skills.
